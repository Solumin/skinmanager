SkinManager TODO

- Third use case (loose files)
- Look for other use cases
	- possibly support a "general case", i.e. user defines where files/folders go
- CLI (using Thor, or maybe just opt parse. Thor may be sledgehammer against fly.)
	- a CLI would probably be much easier to package than a Shoes app, too...
