Adding new skin
1. Download desired skin
2. Extract to a directory
3. Start Skin Manager, select "Add Skin"
4. From directory-select dialog, select dir that skin was extracted to
5. Skin Manager begins processing skin:
	a. If `tf` folder is found in top level of dir:
		1. Copy whole tf/ dir to SKIN_MANN/SKIN_NAME/ (disregard other folders!)
		2. iterate through dirs/files, generating list of files comprising skin
		3. write meta-file for skin (name, files?)
	b. If multiple folders found on top level:
		1. Ignore certain folders ("Screenshots", etc)
		2. Query user for folder structure
			e.g. dir has models and materials. "Do these go right under tf/ dir?"
			basically, ask user to check README or other documentation
		3. Restructure skin to tf/ structure in SKIN_MANN/SKIN_NAME dir
		4. Proceed from step 2 of 5.a above.
	c. No directories, just loose files on top level:
		1. Query user for proper structure
			e.g. "Does this file belong in models or materials? (or other?)"
		2. Restructure skin to tf/ structure in SKIN_MANN/SKIN_NAME dir
		3. Proceed from step 2 of 5.a above.

Deleting a skin
1. Uninstall skin if necessary
2. Delete SKIN_MANN/SKIN_NAME dir
3. Remove any remaining metadata

activating a skin
1. Grab list of files that skin uses/items that skin modifies
2. Check if those files exist in Steam dir
	a. If yes, query user: Overwrite existing files? ("Uninstall other skin first!")
	b. Straight-up overwrite/uninstall previously installed skin if necessary
3. Copy files into Steam dir (merge tf/ directories)
4. Mark skin as installed in SKIN_MANN logs

Unactivating a skin
1. Grap list of files that skin uses
2. Double-check that those files exist (not really necessary)
3. Delete files from Steam dir
4. Mark skin as uninstalled in SKIN_MANN logs

Skin:
	- list of files
	- name (must match skin's directory!)
	? type (weapon/item? What it replaces?)
Each skin resides in its own data/skins/SKIN_NAME directory.
This directory has the marshall dump of the skin class that represents it
and the tf/ folder of the actual skin files.

Skin Manager:
	- defines 4 operations given above
	- maintains lists of installed/uninstalled skins

---
When adding a skin, user can select "one-time add" or "permanent add"
	- one-time: No backup is made. Skin is automatically installed, can only be uninstalled and removed once.
	- permanent: Backup of skin is made. Skin can be installed/uninstalled as many times as desired.
		(Skin can still be automatically installed if user chooses.)
